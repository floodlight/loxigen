#version any

// This extension enables the switch to send only one packet-in for a given flow.
// The goal is to reduce the load on the controller, particularly in the case of
// large UDP streams.
//
// When this extension is enabled (by sending the bsn_set_pktin_suppression message
// described below with enabled=1) the switch will install an exact-match drop
// flow for each packet-in. This flow has the idle_timeout, hard_timeout,
// priority, and cookie fields set to the values given in the
// bsn_set_pktin_suppression message.
//
// This extension does not affect packet-ins caused by an output to
// OFPP_CONTROLLER.
//
// When this extension is enabled the switch may still send multiple packet-ins
// for the same flow.
//
// This extension keeps its configuration across controller disconnects. When a
// controller that is aware of this extension connects to a switch it should send
// a DELETE flow-mod with the cookie field set to ensure that it receives
// packet-ins for ongoing flows.
//
// The flows installed by this extension are not automatically deleted when the
// extension is disabled. Similarly other configuration changes (cookie, etc) do
// not affect already-installed flows.
//
// The switch should reject the message if both 'hard_timeout' and 'idle_timeout'
// are zero, since the suppression flows would never expire.
