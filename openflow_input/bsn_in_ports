/*
 * Bitmap of input ports
 *
 * The representation is not straightforward, but it works with existing OXM
 * semantics.
 *
 * The value should always be zero. The mask should be unset in every bit position
 * where the corresponding input port is allowed, and set in all other bits.
 * As a special case, the highest bit in the mask is reserved for higher port
 * numbers than can be represented in the bitmap.
 *
 * The value1 and value_mask1 fields contain the most significant bits. value2
 * and value_mask2 contain the least significant bits.
 *
 * Pseudocode for populating value or mask:
 *   bitmap |= in_port < 128 ? (1 << in_port) : (1 << 127)
