// This asynchronous message is used by the switch to notify the controller
// when an entry in the ARP table has been idle for longer than its configured
// timeout. Similar to the flow idle notification (see bsn_flow_idle), the
// notification will be resent every timeout interval, and the switch will
// not remove the table entry on its own.
