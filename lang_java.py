@brief Java language specific LOXI generating configuration

This language specific file defines:

target_files:  List of internal references to files to generate
file_gen_map: The map from above file references to generator functions
file_to_name_map: The map from internal references to external file names
file_to_subdir_map: The map from internal references to external subdirectories

HOWEVER, since java files are all a function of their class name, we don't
know in advance what the names of the files/classes will be, so we just
define a single directory and generate everything in there.
    @fixme talk to DanT to see if there isn't something that makes more sense
