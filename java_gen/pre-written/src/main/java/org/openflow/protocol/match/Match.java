/**
 * Generic interface for version-agnostic immutable Match structure.
 * The Match structure is defined in the OpenFlow protocol, and it contains information on
 * the fields to be matched in a specific flow record.
 * This interface does not assume anything on the fields in the Match structure. If in
 * some version, the match structure cannot handle a certain field, it may return <code>false</code>
 * for <code>supports(...)</code> calls, and throw <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> from all
 * other methods in such cases.
 * <br><br>
 * On wildcards and masks:<br>
 * This interface defines the following masking notations for fields:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Exact</b>: field is matched exactly against a single, fixed value (no mask, or mask is all ones).
 * <li><b>Wildcarded</b>: field is not being matched. It is fully masked (mask=0) and any value of it
 * will match the flow record having this match.
 * <li><b>Partially masked</b>: field is matched using a specified mask which is neither 0 nor all ones. Mask can
 * be either arbitrary or require some specific structure.
 * </ul>
 * Implementing classes may or may not support all types of these masking types. They may also support
 * them in part. For example, OF1.0 supports exact match and (full) wildcarding for all fields, but it
 * does only supports partial masking for IP source/destination fields, and this partial masking must be
 * in the CIDR prefix format. Thus, OF1.0 implementation may throw <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if given
 * in <code>setMaksed</code> an IP mask of, for example, 255.0.255.0, or if <code>setMasked</code> is called for any field
 * which is not IP source/destination address.
 * <br><br>
 * On prerequisites:<br>
 * From the OF1.1 spec, page 28, the OF1.0 spec failed to explicitly specify this, but it
 * is the behavior of OF1.0 switches:
 * "Protocol-specific fields within ofp_match will be ignored within a single table when
 * the corresponding protocol is not specified in the match. The MPLS match fields will
 * be ignored unless the Ethertype is specified as MPLS. Likewise, the IP header and
 * transport header fields will be ignored unless the Ethertype is specified as either
 * IPv4 or ARP. The tp_src and tp_dst fields will be ignored unless the network protocol
 * specified is as TCP, UDP or SCTP. Fields that are ignored donï¿½t need to be wildcarded
 * and should be set to 0."
 * <br><br>
 * This interface uses generics to assure type safety in users code. However, implementing classes may have to suppress
 * 'unchecked cast' warnings while making sure they correctly cast base on their implementation details.
