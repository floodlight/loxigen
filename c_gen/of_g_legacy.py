# The list of wire versions which are to be supported

##
# The dictionary of config variables related to code
#
# @param use_obj_id  Use object IDs in struct defns   CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTED
#
# @param return_base_types For 'get' accessors, return values when possible.
# Otherwise all values are returned thru a call by variable parameter
#
# @param use_static_inlines Generate low level accessors as static inline
# and put them in header files rather than .c files.
#
# @param copy_semantics One of "read", "write" or "grow".  This defines the
# way that buffer references are managed.  Currently on "read" is supported.
#
# @param encode_typedefs Use object and member IDs (rather than names)
# when generating the names used for accessor function typedefs
#
# @param get_returns One of "error", "value", or "void";
# CURRENTLY ONLY "error" IS SUPPORTED.  "error" means
# all get operations return an error code.  "value" means return a base_type
# value when possible or void if not.  "void" means always return void
# and use a call-by-variable parameter
