Introduction
============

LoxiGen is a tool that generates OpenFlow protocol libraries for a number of
languages. It is composed of a frontend that parses wire protocol descriptions
and a backend for each supported language (currently C and Python, with Java on
the way).


Usage
=====

You can run LoxiGen directly from the repository. There's no need to install it,
and it has no dependencies beyond Python 2.7+.

To generate the libraries for all languages:

```
make
```

To generate the library for a single language:

```
make c
```

The currently supported languages are `c` and `python`.

The generated libraries will be under the `loxi_output` directory. This can be
changed with the `LOXI_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable when using the Makefile.

Each generated library comes with its own set of documentation in the standard
format for that language. Please see that documentation for more details on
using the generated libraries.
