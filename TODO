Dummy

For lists of uint32 and uint8, the easy approach was taken which was to
add OF types (wrappers) for instances of these types.  This makes some
things much easier, but makes it awkward, for example, to simply append
a 32-bit value to the end of a list.  Some helper functions should be
added to make this easier.  (Maybe?  Seems to be working so far.)

With the added support for auto declaring var len arrays indexed by
version, lots of trailing commas have been added.

Add type and length support for action_id classes.

Table feature prop uses 0xfffe instead of 0xffff as the experimenter value.

Support TABLE_FEATURE_PROP_EXPERIMENTER/_MISS
