Python backend for LOXI

This language specific file defines a dictionary 'targets' that
defines the generated files and the functions used to generate them.

For each generated file there is a generate_* function in py_gen.codegen
and a Tenjin template under py_gen/templates.

Target directory structure:
    pyloxi:
        loxi:
            __init__.py
            of10:
                __init__.py
                action.py       # Action classes
                common.py       # Structs shared by multiple messages
                const.py        # OpenFlow constants
                message.py      # Message classes
                util.py         # Utility functions
            of12: ...
            of13: ...

The user will add the pyloxi directory to PYTHONPATH. Then they can
"import loxi" or "import loxi.of10". The idiomatic import is
"import loxi.of10 as ofp". The protocol modules (e.g. of10) import
all of their submodules, so the user can access "ofp.message" without
further imports. The protocol modules also import the constants from
the const module directly into their namespace so the user can access
"ofp.OFPP_NONE".
